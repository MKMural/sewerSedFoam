Both Scenarios have three folders along with the main results within them:

- Initialization: Where suspended sediment concentration is initialized through the channel for 100 seconds from a start time of 20 seconds to 120 seconds with changing bed morphology off, this is achieved by commenting out the inclusion of meshMove.H from exnerBed.h (line 98) and recompiling sewerSedFoam.

- Day1-2: Bed morphology is turned back on along with a scaling of 100 times the bed height. Deposition scaling is active to a constant height for the entire channel and the simulation was run until a stable bed height was achieved. Stable results in the 900 folder.

- Day3-4: Bed morphology is on along with a 100 times scaling. Scaling is now active till the stable bed height from the Day1-2 stableFinal heights, stored in the 900 folder. Simulation also run till a stable bed height was achieved, results in the 1800 folder.


Please note that the initialization of the flow velocity field has not been included in these files, but can easily be replicated with the boundary condition information provided.
